= Favorite Coffee -- Coffee recommendation with Neo4J and Quarkus

How to build a coffee beans recommendation with Neo4J and Quarkus.


== To try

Requires Docker, Maven, JDK 16, and `cypher-shell` (or alternatively run the Cypher-Queries in your IDE or the http://localhost:7474/browser/[Neo4J Browser^]).

You can start a fresh Neo4J instance with:

[source,bash]
----
./run-graph-db.sh
----

In another terminal, run the following to create the sample data:

[source,bash]
----
cypher-shell -u neo4j -p test --file deployment/migration/load-coffee-data.cypher
----

Then build and run the application:

[source,bash]
----
mvn package
java -jar target/favorite-coffee-runner.jar
----

Or you run the development mode with:

[source,bash]
----
mvn quarkus:dev
----

Then, explore the coffee website at: http://localhost:8080/

In case running a Neo4J instance in Docker locally doesn't work for you, you can use https://neo4j.com/cloud/aura/[Neo4J Aura^] for a free instance.
For this, change your `application.properties` as follows:

----
# Your Neo4J Aura URI, use `neo4j` instead of `neo4j+s`, due to a Quarkus issue in 2.1.2
quarkus.neo4j.uri=neo4j://xxxxab01.databases.neo4j.io
quarkus.neo4j.encrypted=true
quarkus.neo4j.authentication.username=neo4j
quarkus.neo4j.authentication.password=[...]
----
