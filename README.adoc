= Favorite Coffee -- Coffee recommendation with Neo4J and Quarkus

How to build a coffee beans recommendation with Neo4J and Quarkus.


== To try

TODO

Requires Docker, Maven, JDK 14, and `cypher-shell` (or alternatively run the Cypher-Queries in your IDE or the http://localhost:7474/browser/[Neo4J Browser^]).

You can start a fresh Neo4J instance with:

[source,bash]
----
./run-graph-db.sh
----

In another terminal, run the following to create the sample data:

[source,bash]
----
cypher-shell -u neo4j -p test --file deployment/migration/load-coffee-data.csv
----

Then build and run the application:

[source,bash]
----
mvn package
java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar 
----

Or you run the development mode with:

[source,bash]
----
mvn quarkus:dev
----

Then query the coffee beans with (with or without `jq`):

[source,bash]
----
curl localhost:8080/beans/ | jq .
curl "localhost:8080/beans?flavor=fruit" | jq .
curl localhost:8080/beans/special | jq .
----
